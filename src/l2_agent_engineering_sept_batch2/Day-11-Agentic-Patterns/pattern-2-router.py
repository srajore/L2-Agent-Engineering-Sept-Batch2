"""Session 11: router pattern rebuilt as an agent.

Problem: an IT helpdesk gets free-text requests and must send each one to
one of two specialists -- network or account. A workflow would route with a
plain if/else rule (see Day-04-Routing-Control-Flow/example.py for exactly
that technique). Here the model reads the request and its own output picks
the specialist, and LangGraph routes to a different node depending on that
output -- that is this course's own definition of the agent boundary
(CLAUDE.md: "the agent boundary is specifically ... where the model's
output selects the next node").
