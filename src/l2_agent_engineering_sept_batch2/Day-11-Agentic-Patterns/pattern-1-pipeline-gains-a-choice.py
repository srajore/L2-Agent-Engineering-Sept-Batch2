"""Session 11: what a fixed pipeline looks like once it gains a real choice.

Problem: a plain fixed pipeline (receive -> reply -> close, every ticket the
same three steps in the same order) has no decision point, so adding a
model call to it would still be a workflow -- a bare model call is not what
makes something an agent. Here the ticket gets a genuine two-way choice:
close it with a standard reply, or escalate to a human. The model's own
output makes that choice and LangGraph routes to a different node depending
on it -- so this is an agent.
